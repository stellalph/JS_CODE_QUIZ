## TASK
The task is to build a timed coding quiz on Javascript fundamentals that the stores high scores of the quizzers so that the progress can be compared. The user's quiz score is based on the number of questions they get correct as time/score is subtracted from the clock for incorrect answers.  User scores are saved to the local storage and remain available for viewing (View HighScores) once the user has completed the quiz.

I have chosen the free images from the website:-
